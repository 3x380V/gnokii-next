  which is (I hope) more portable under MS Windows.

  from phone and also we can edit and save them to phone.

- Source completely rewriten. New design. Inbox and outbox in tree
  hierarchy. If you have initialized contacts in xgnokii, xgnokii is trying
  to resolve numbers to names. Messages are shown in viewer space.

  about graphical representation of Net monitor data. I thank also Norbert

- Added SMS settings windows. Xgnokii can only read SMS centers numbers from
  phone. I can't read SMS set name, SMS format and Validity period from phone.
  I can't also write any SMS setting in phone. And I don't know differencies
  between SMS formats. :(
- Added Groups names edit window. I can change group names in xgnokii. But
  I can't read or write group names from/to phone because I don't have support
  in gnokii.

  phone. It can't unset alarm because lack support in gnokii.

  can't test it.
