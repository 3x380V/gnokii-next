<p>gnokii makes use of autoconf/automake which allows you to configure
the source tree for your system by typing 

<p><i>./configure</i>

<p>You can also run configure with the --help flag to get a list of 
available options.  There are about a dozen or so that are specific
to gnokii.

<p>Once you've run ./configure successfully, you should be able to
simply do a make and make install to compile and install your 
binaries respectively.

<p><i>make</i>

<p><i>make install</i>

<p>With this done you've built and installed your binaries, and
should proceed to the configuration section below.

<hr align="LEFT" size="3" width="300" color="#60c0a0" noshade>

<p>If you downloaded gnokii as a pre-built binary you should install
it in the conventional manner for the package type in question.
For example if you downloaded a .rpm file you can install it by
running the following as root.

<p>rpm -i gnokii-0.3.2-i386.rpm

<p>If you are using a Debian based system, you can use dpackage
to do the installation (FIXME - is this correct ?)

<p><font color="#1F409F" size=+2 class="dzial">How to make connection with phone ?</font><br>
<hr align="LEFT" size="3" width="300" color="#60c0a0" noshade>

<p>There are three ways to make it:

<ul>
<li>connecting phone with computer using cable. All phones allow to make it
(even 3210 - connector is inside). If you want to know more
about creating your own cable, read <a href=cables/cables.html>cables faq</a>.</li>
<li>using IrDa port in phone and computer. Notice, that your computer
and phone must have it (only some series of Nokia phones has it - for example,
6110, 6150)</li>
<li>connecting to phone special device called "dongle" (it has IrDa port)
and making IrDa connection between it and phone. Current gnokii cas use
Tekram IRmate 210 - see patches</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#1F409F" size=+2 class="dzial">How to configure gnokii ?</font><br>
<hr align="LEFT" size="3" width="300" color="#60c0a0" noshade>

<p>You could copy the <a href=sample/gnokiirc>sample/gnokiirc</a>
file from the Docs/en_US/samples directory to your
home directory and name it .gnokiirc or copy it into /etc directory
and name .gnokiirc.

<p>Using your favorite
editor ensure that the settings are correct for your system,
the sample file has details of the various options available. The most
difficult problem could be discovering model of your phone - go into
our <a href=firmware/firmware.html>firmware page</a>
and try to use codes written in column
<b>Firmware version code</b>. If your phone will display something,
see model number on the third line, look on the
<a href=firmware/firmware.htm>firmware page</a>
again (for it) and read phone model then.

<p>Note that you will need read/write permissions on whatever
serial port you specify in .gnokiirc.  You can now use gnokii
and xgnokii.

<p><font color="#1F409F" size=+2 class="dzial">How to configure infrared connection ?</font><br>
<hr align="LEFT" size="3" width="300" color="#60c0a0" noshade>

<p>
<ul>

<li>Go into configuration of your IrDa port (the most often it's made in
BIOS, sometimes using program provided by computer's producer):

<p>
<ul>
<li>Enable it</li>
<li>Setup the COM-Port on which it should work.
Here are addresses:
<br>ttyS0 (COM1): 3F8, IRQ: 4
<br>ttyS1 (COM2): 2F8, IRQ: 3
<br>ttyS2 (COM3): 3E8, IRQ: 4
<br>ttyS3 (COM4): 2E8, IRQ: 3
<br>&nbsp;
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Configure gnokii (see previous question)
setting type of connection to
infrared.</li>

<li>If you are using linux, put linux-irda off (you can't use gnokii over infrared and
linux-irda at the same time - it means too, if you want use
linux-irda you must close all gnokii-applications what
use the infrared-port in moment).
</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#1F409F" size=+2 class="dzial">How to configure gnokii driver for data connection ?</font><br>
<hr align="LEFT" size="3" width="300" color="#60c0a0" noshade>

<p>After installing and configuring gnokii you should make another group
and allow mgnokiidev to use it. For example (if you have installed gnokii
into /usr/local):

<p>
<i>groupadd gnokii<br>
chown root:gnokii /usr/local/sbin/mgnokiidev<br>
chmod 4750 /usr/local/sbin/mgnokiidev</i>

<p>Then connect your phone to your PC and then run gnokiid:

<p><i># gnokiid</i>

<p>If successful, you should see a message saying that mgnokiidev has been
run to create /dev/gnokii.  If you're using a 5110/6110 series phone
you should hear a beep and see an "accessory connected" message on
the phone.  If you're using a 3810 series phone you won't see anything
on the phones LCD.

<p>[I run gnokiid as root; it will probably work for another user who is
in group gnokii, as long as the serial port is accessible to that
user as well.  It's not recommended that you run gnokiid as root
permanently however!]

<p>Use /dev/gnokii as a modem:

<p><i>e.g. ppp session<br>
--------------- /etc/ppp/peers/demon-gnokii ---------------------<br>
/dev/gnokii 115200<br>
modem crtscts defaultroute<br>
connect 'chat -v ABORT BUSY ABORT ERROR ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" AT OK-AT-OK ATD02083389666 CONNECT'<br>
user XXXX.demon.co.uk<br>
noauth<br>
mtu 296<br>
debug<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
--------------- /etc/ppp/pap-secrets ---------------------------<br>
XXXX.demon.co.uk	demon-gnokii	<yourpassword><br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
</i>

<p>Then "pppd call demon-gnokii" should connect
<br>('tail -f /var/log/messages' to see what is happening)

<p>If a call terminates you should get 'NO CARRIER' and gnokiid should
continue to work, but this is early code and you may find you have to
Ctrl-C and restart gnokiid (especially if the phone says the terminal
connection has been lost)
