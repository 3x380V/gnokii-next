- FreeBSD build and work
- international catalogs
- Debian GNU/Linux package
- Red Hat Linux package
- fill in all co-authors names in CREDITS, if you have something in gnokii,
  do not hesitate to send me the patch with your name :-) If you do not have
  nothing, you should do something or your name will not be there :-))
- test RLP setup as per RLP-guide in Docs.
- Marcin's setprofile
- test all gnokii options and xgnokii
- --disable-debug should really disable debug :-)

0.4.0 THINGS:

- gnokiid and other AT commands.

- we should report back to xgnokii what functions are and which are not
  supported so xgnokii can disable some GUI stuff on phones which do not
  support this functions.
