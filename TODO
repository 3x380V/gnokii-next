0.4.0 THINGS:

= Documentation:
  - update spec file for instalation of manual page
  - write some docs about gnokiid -- beeing written

- --disable-debug should really disable debug :-)
- FreeBSD build and work - is it done already?
- 6160 support (is this useful: http://www.venia.net/tdma/? - yes it was -HAB)
  Please email Hugh before delving into x160 support.
- 7110 support (fbus and/or plain AT commands)
- integrate xlogos into xgnokii
- incoming RLP calls (will anyone actually use this?)
- other mobile phones (Ericsson, Siemens? - any support from vendor? Are they
  better then Nokia? in this? Any programs already existing?)
- getsecuritycode patch (I have it in ~/ so if there is anyone interested... We
  must include it in ---with-security).
- international characters in SMS messages and phonebooks - see the mailing
  list messages in archive -- almost done for SMS
- Business card sending via SMS (I do not know if it is already implemented or
  not)
- if GNU getopt is not available in the system, use compile getopt from
  source tree (move it from win32/)
- gnokiid and other AT commands.
- we should report back to xgnokii what functions are and which are not
  supported so xgnokii can disable some GUI stuff on phones which do not
  support this functions.  (Should be an extension to existing GSM_Information
  structure - HAB)
- multiframed packets
- how can we read the name of the uploaded tune? Can we do that?
- SMS errors (Gary reported them on Fri, 25 Feb 2000 15:55:58 -0500 (EST))
- storing of SMS messages into INBOX (Pavel already sent the dump of such
  message) -- done, not applied
- Marcin's setprofile patch
- --getdisplaystatus and Alarm sign? Is there any indication of it?
- gnokii --setlogo logofile [caller group number] [group name] is not
  working correctly as is
- --netmonitor field/devel should not report the menu (which contains
  useless data)... Try it.
- integrate Marcin's patches
