0.3.2 THINGS:

- gnokiid segfaults (these are now fixed ? -HAB)
- FreeBSD build and work
- international catalogs
- Debian GNU/Linux package
- Red Hat Linux package
- fill in all co-authors names in CREDITS, if you have something in gnokii,
  do not hesitate to send Hugh or Pavel the patch with your name :-)
  If you do nothing your name will not be there :-))
- test RLP setup as per RLP-guide in Docs.
- Marcin's setprofile patch
- test all gnokii options and xgnokii
- --disable-debug should really disable debug :-)

0.4.0 THINGS:

- use config.h for autoconf stuff
- remove default MODEL and PORT, use config files only and bug the user if
  /etc/gnokiirc or ~/.gnokiirc is not found
- move VERSION, DEBUG, SECURITY and USE_NLS to config.h
- 6160 support (is this useful: http://www.venia.net/tdma/? - yes it was - HAB)
  Please email Hugh before delving into x160 support.
- 7110 support (plain AT commands)
- integrate xlogos into xgnokii
- other mobile phones (?)
- incoming RLP calls (will anyone actually use this ?)
- other mobile phones (Ericsson, Siemens?)
- incoming RLP calls
- getsecuritycode patch (I have it in ~/ so if there is anyone interested...)
- international characters in SMS messages and phonebooks - see the mailing
  list messages in archive
- Bussines card sending via SMS (I do not know if it is already implemented or
  not)
- if GNU getopt is not available in the system, use compile getopt from
  source tree (move it from win32/)
- gnokiid and other AT commands.
- write some docs about gnokiid.
- we should report back to xgnokii what functions are and which are not
  supported so xgnokii can disable some GUI stuff on phones which do not
  support this functions.  (Should be an extension to existing GSM_Information
  structure - HAB)
- multiframed packets
- how can we read the name of the uploaded tune? Can we do that?
- SMS errors (Gary reported them on Fri, 25 Feb 2000 15:55:58 -0500 (EST))
- storing of SMS messages into INBOX
- --setringtone (see --foogle)
- write a function which periodically scans for new SMS messages (an
  argument is the interval between checks in seconds)
