0.3.2 THINGS:

- gnokiid segfaults
- AT vs at in gnokiid. It should be case insensitive.
- FreeBSD build and work
- international catalogs
- Debian GNU/Linux package
- Red Hat Linux package
- fill in all co-authors names in CREDITS, if you have something in gnokii,
  do not hesitate to send me the patch with your name :-) If you do not have
  nothing, you should do something or your name will not be there :-))
- test RLP setup as per RLP-guide in Docs.
- Marcin's profile and dealer note patches.
- update Docs/gettext-howto
- test all gnokii options and xgnokii
- fill in all ringing tone names in gnokii.h and gnokii.c


0.4.0 THINGS:

- use config.h for autoconf stuff

  /etc/gnokiirc or ~/.gnokiirs is not found
- move VERSION, DEBUG, SECURITY and USE_NLS to config.h
- 6160 support (is this useful: http://www.venia.net/tdma/ ?)
- 7110 support (plain AT commands)
- integrate xlogos into xgnokii
- other mobile phones (?)
- incoming RLP calls
- getsecuritycode patch
- international characters in SMS messages and phonebooks - see the mailing
  list messages in archive
- Calendar notes and bussines card sending via SMS (I do not know if it is
  already implemented or not)
- if GNU getopt is not available in the system, use compile getopt from
  source tree (move it from win32/)
- gnokiid and other AT commands.
- write some docs about gnokiid.
- we should report back to xgnokii what functions are and which are not
  supported so xgnokii can disable some GUI stuff on phones which do not
  support this functions.
- multiframed packets
