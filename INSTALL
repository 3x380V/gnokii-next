Gnokii installation instructions
================================

[NOTE: For package building see the 'Docs/packaging-howto' file.]


Quickstart
==========

    $ autoconf			# only for CVS copies
    $ autoheader		# only for CVS copies
    $ ./configure [<options>]
    $ make
    # groupadd gnokii
    # make [install|install-suid|install-strip|install-ss]
    # make install-docs
    $ cp Docs/sample/gnokiirc ~/.gnokiirc
    $ $EDITOR ~/.gnokiirc


Verbose instructions
====================

Preparations
------------

If you retrieved this copy from CVS, then first call

    $ autoconf
    $ autoheader

Now you have to determine your system specific settings.

    $ ./configure [<options>]

Basic options are:

    --prefix=DIR
	Sets the install path prefix. Default is /usr/local/.

    --without-x
	Compiles without GTK (X11) programs.
		
    --disable-nls
	Set if you don't have/want GNU gettext support.

    --enable-security
	Set if you want to enable all security features supported by your 
        mobile (PIN change, etc.).

    --enable-debug
	Set if you want debug code compiled in.

    --help		
	Shows all options.

This example is commonly used:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-security

Alternatively, instead of writing these three commands you can use:

    $ sh autogen.sh [<options>]

where options are the same as with configure script.


Compilation
-----------

Start the compilation process by typing

    $ make

or

    $ make gnokii-debug

The second form creates statically linked binaries. These are mainly used 
for debugging the software.


Installation
------------

Now switch to the root account and add a group named "gnokii". Gnokii 
really needs an own group. It is added with

    # groupadd gnokii


Install the binaries into the system with one of the four following lines:

    # make install
    # make install-suid
    # make install-strip
    # make install-ss          # <-- suid AND strip

If you wish to install gnokii stuff in some other directory root (eg. when
creating a distribution package), you can take an advantage of the DESTDIR
variable:

    $ make DESTDIR=/somewhere install

To install the documentation type

    # make install-docs


Clean-up
--------

To remove products of the compile process, type

    $ make clean

Calling

    $ make distclean

additionaly cleans all ./configure outputs. After this command you must 
run ./configure again if you need to use any Makefile.


Configuration
-------------

Copy the example config file for gnokii from the Docs/sample/ directory to
your home directory:

    $ cp Docs/sample/gnokiirc ~/.gnokiirc

It is a plain ASCII file which can be read in any editor. Make sure you do 
not save it in a wordprocessor's binary-format. It has to remain plain 
text. vi, mcedit, kedit are good examples.

Change the settings to fit your system. Lines beginning with a `#' are 
comments. The file should be self-explaining.
