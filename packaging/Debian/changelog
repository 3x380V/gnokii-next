    promised to change this in the future

  * setting mgnokiidev root SUID in postinst script rather than "make install"
  * rewrote postrm script to do all of its work on "purge"
  * updated Build-Depends to include libc6-dev, xlibs-dev, xutils (for xmkmf), 
    and libgtk1.2-dev.  Note that autoconf is recommended.
  * added "touch Makefile.global" to debian/rules to allow "make clean" on
    un"./configure"d builds
