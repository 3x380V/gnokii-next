/* Nokia authentication protocol is used in the communication between Nokia
   mobile phones (e.g. Nokia 6110) and Nokia Cellular Data Suite software,
   commercially sold by Nokia Corp.

   The authentication scheme is based on the token send by the phone to the
   software. The software does it's magic (see the function
   FB61_GetNokiaAuth()) and returns the result back to the phone. If the
   result is correct the phone responds with the message "Accessory
   connected!" displayed on the LCD. Otherwise it will display "Accessory not
   supported" and some functions will not be available for use.

   The specification of the protocol is not publicly available, no comment. */
