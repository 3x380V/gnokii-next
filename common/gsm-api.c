  Provides a generic API for accessing functions on the phone, wherever
  possible hiding the model specific details.

  The underlying code should run in it's own thread to allow communications to
  the phone to be run independantly of mailing code that calls these API
  functions.

  Unless otherwise noted, all functions herein block until they complete.  The
  functions themselves are defined in a structure in gsm-common.h.
