-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 6510 series --

* Notes *

First of all: Phones supported by this driver so far are:
 * 6510
 * 8310
 * 6310
 * 6310i
All the newest phones should work with this driver, too, i.e. 7610, 7210
once they are out. If you have any of these phones, please test it with
model set to 6510 and give report to the ML.

Code for the 6510 phones has been tested with DAU-9P and DLR-3P cables and
IrDA connection. The following conection type values are recommended for the
various connection media:

-----------------------------------------
| Media		| Connection type	|
|---------------------------------------|
| dau9p		| dau9p or serial	|
| dlr3p		| dlr3p			|
| IrDA		| irda			|
-----------------------------------------
When you don't know what your cable is you can first try serial value.

The current code is able to:
 * identify the phone ;-)
 * read/write phonebook entries
 * read SMS messages of all kinds
 * read SMS centers
 * send basic text messages
 * read/write calendar entries
 * read the memory status
 * read/write bitmaps (group, operator logos)
 * read network info
 * read RF/battery level
 * read date/time
 * read list of ringtones
 * read/write profiles
 * read WAP bookmarks/settings
 * read/write/delete ToDo entries
 * create/delete SMS folders
 * save SMS messages to phone (may be dangerous)

Hint: For all these phones you can also use AT driver, as they all have a
builtin hardware modem.

* Bugs *

 * when using dlr3p connection type after the several sequent connection the
   phone got puzzled and you need to reset it to be able to connect it again
   (or also enable IrDA)

* TODO *

 * implement further functionality
