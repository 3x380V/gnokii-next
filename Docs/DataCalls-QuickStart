           QUICK-START GUIDE TO RLP DATA CALLS USING GNOKII

(1) Compile and install gnokii as per instructions in the INSTALL file.

e.g.

   cd /usr/src
   tar xvfz /tmp/gnokii-0.3.2.tar.gz
   cd gnokii-0.3.2
   ./configure --enable-nls --with-x --with-model=6110 --with-port=/dev/ttyS2
   make
   make install

   groupadd gnokii
   chown root:gnokii /usr/local/sbin/mgnokiidev
   chmod 4750 /usr/local/sbin/mgnokiidev

(2) Create /etc/gnokiirc

   cp Docs/sample.gnokiirc /etc/gnokiirc

   Edit to suit; in my case:

   [global]
   port = /dev/ttyS2
   model = 6150
   initlength = default
   connection = serial
   bindir = /usr/local/sbin/

(3) Connect your phone to your PC and then run gnokiid:

   # gnokiid

   If successful, you should see a message saying that mgnokiidev has been
   run to create /dev/gnokii.  If you're using a 5110/6110 series phone
   you should hear a beep and see an "accessory connected" message on
   the phone.  If you're using a 3810 series phone you won't see anything
   on the phones LCD.

   [I run gnokiid as root; it will probably work for another user who is
    in group gnokii, as long as the serial port is accessible to that
    user as well.  It's not recommended that you run gnokiid as root
    permanently however!]

(4) Use /dev/gnokii as a modem:

e.g. ppp session
--------------- /etc/ppp/peers/demon-gnokii ---------------------
/dev/gnokii 115200
modem crtscts defaultroute
connect 'chat -v ABORT BUSY ABORT ERROR ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" AT OK-AT-OK ATD02083389666 CONNECT'
user XXXX.demon.co.uk
noauth
mtu 296
debug
----------------------------------------------------------------
--------------- /etc/ppp/pap-secrets ---------------------------
XXXX.demon.co.uk	demon-gnokii	<yourpassword>
----------------------------------------------------------------

    Then "pppd call demon-gnokii" should connect
    ('tail -f /var/log/messages' to see what is happening)

(5) If a call terminates you should get 'NO CARRIER' and gnokiid should
    continue to work, but this is early code and you may find you have to
    Ctrl-C and restart gnokiid (especially if the phone says the terminal
    connection has been lost)
