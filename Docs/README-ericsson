A1018s
======

* Communicates with AT commands, with few possible extensions like
pressing keys (AT+CKPD="X", x is 0..9, # * < > s==yes, e==no, c==clr).

* Contains AVR RISC cpu, and its internals are pretty well known (see
http://www.subdimension.com/community/scitech/ga628/a1018.htm), people
are writing their own firmware with arkanoid, for example.

* Its quite easy to flash firmware there.

* Works with gnokii, use model AT as hardware type and add
serial_baudrate = 9600 option to make it work.
