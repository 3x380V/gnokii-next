*** Notes, Install, bugs etc for the DKU2 Linux kernel module ***


* Notes *

The DKU2 cable, supplied for example with the nokia 7600, is a straight-through lead which connects the phone to a USB port.  By default, the usb device exposes two endpoints which provide AT-like modem emulation.  This kernel module sets an alternative configuration to enable two further endpoints which enable Fbus communication.

Patches are in gnokii/patches.  So far only for 2.4.22 - I expect it'll work with most 2.4 kernels.

The driver connects two ttys - after connecting the phone dmesg gives:
  Nokia AT Port:
  usbserial.c: Nokia 7600/DKU2 driver converter now attached to ttyUSB0 (or usb/tts/0 for devfs)
  Nokia FBUS Port:
  usbserial.c: Nokia 7600/DKU2 driver converter now attached to ttyUSB1 (or usb/tts/1 for devfs)
gnokii must be configured to use the second of these - in this case /dev/ttyUSB1


* Install *

- Get / configure / build a set of kernel sources.
- cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/serial
- patch < patch_file
- cd ../../..
- make xconfig
- Enable the module (USB support / USB serial converter support / USB Nokia Serial Driver)
- make modules
- Become root
- make modules_install
- modprobe nokia_dku2
- dmesg
- Look for the lines as shown above!
- Edit .gnokiirc to include port=/dev/ttyUSB.. and connection=dku2 


* Known Bugs *

None...let me know!
