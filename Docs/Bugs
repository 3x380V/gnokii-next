When you report some problems with gnokii please attach the following information:
 - phone model
 - connection type (irda/cable with its type)
 - gnokii version (gnokii --version) along with source for it: cvs,
tarball, binary package
 - edit you gnokiirc and enable debugging, e.g.:
    [logging]
    debug = on
   and attach gzipped output to the email:
    (x)gnokii(d) [parameters] 2>errfile

It would be good if you name the problem in the subject if possible and
name if it meets gnokii, xgnokii or gnokiid binaries or gnokii as a whole.

(from Pawel Kot's mailing to gnokii mailing list).

Send resulting report to gnokii-users@nongnu.org.

If you want to debug yourself, you may want to add -g to CFLAGS in Makefile.global,
and run autogen.sh (or configure) with --enable-debug to debug gnokii or libgnokii
and --enable-xdebug to debug xgnokii or smsd. The CVS version has these options set
and you might add --disable-shared to build statically linked versions that are
easier to deal with.
make clean; make and then you can make install or run the programs from their
directory if they are statically linked: 
 gnokii/gnokii
 xgnokii/xgnokii
