When you report some problems with gnokii please attach the following information:
 - phone model
 - connection type (irda/cable with its type)
 - gnokii version (gnokii --version) along with source for it: cvs,
tarball, binary package
 - if you can, compile gnokii with --enable-debug option for configure and
attach gzipped output to the email:
(x)gnokii(d) [parameters] 2>errfile

It would be good if you name the problem in the subject if possible and
name if it meets gnokii, xgnokii or gnokiid binaries or gnokii as a whole.

(from Pawel Kot's mailing to gnokii mailing list).

Send resulting report to gnokii@net.lut.ac.uk.

If you want to debug yourself, you may want to add -g to CFLAGS in Makefile.global,
make clean; make and then make gnokii-debug in common directory. gnokii-debug is
statically linked, and easier to deal with.
