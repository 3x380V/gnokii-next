Q. What is gnokii?

A. It is a name of project. The aim of it is to develop tools and drivers
   for Nokia mobile phones. Of course, I think in this moment about really
   different tools - for example, modem drivers, console tools, etc.
   All created here software is released under the GNU
   General Public License. Please see COPYING file for more details on
   license/copying issues, the lack of warranty and where to send a postcard
   if you like gnokii :-). Anyway, our software works on many software
   (Linux, Free BSD, etc.) and hardware (Intel, etc.) platforms...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do you pronounce gnokii?

A. You can pronounce gnokii as "gnooki" or "gnocki" at your option :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What models are supported?

A. Currently supported phone models are (if not marked, it's a Nokia phone):
         + 6110|6130|6150|6190|5110|5130|5190|3310|3210|3330|3360|3410|8210|8290
         + 5160|6160|6185
         + 7110|6210|6250|7190
         + 6210|7110|6250
         + 6310|6310i|6510|8310
         + AT mode compatible phones (namely Nokia 62X0, Nokia 7110,
           Nokia 8210, Nokia 6310, Nokia 6510, Ericsson T39, Sony-Ericsson
           T68i, Siemens S25 are known to work)
   Support for these models is obsoleted. If noone is interested in
   development for them, the support will be dropped:
         + 640
         + 3110|3810|8110|8110i
         + 2110|2140|6080
         + Dancall 2711 and 2713

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get "Hmmm... GSM_LinkOK never went true. Quitting." message when
   running gnokii. What's wrong?

A. Gnokii cannot connect to the phone. Possible reasons are:
    - wrong serial port is defined in gnokii config file,
    - you are using the wrong cable,
    - you are using not supported phone model,
    - you don't have permission to write to /dev/ttySX device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does mgnokiidev need to be suid root?

A. Yes. gnokiid needs to create a symbolic link in the /dev directory.
   mgnokiidev is the program which does this and hence it must be suid
   root so it can write to the directory. mgnokiidev is executable only
   for gnokii group members (and root) so it presents minimal security
   problems. Be sure that you use not older then 0.3.5 gnokii version if
   you want to install mkgnokiidev suid root and give the access for
   execution for not trusted people. The former versions had security
   problems and allowed people to write to an arbitrary file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Should any other gnokii binary be installed suid root?

A. No. There's no need for it. gnokii isn't intended for setuid/setgid
   operation. If you put the setuid/setgid bit on, you takes a huge security
   risk. All you need it read/write permission for the device you are using
   for connection (port option in the config file). You can safely do it
   using groups management.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Can I use IrDA with 6210/7110 and gnokii?

A: Yes. Just put:
connection = irda
   line into your config file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I get a copy of the protocol for the <insert phone model here>?

A. We don't have any formal documentation of the protocols in use.
   The best source we can give you now is all our knowlegde assembled
   together by Nagy Balazs and Marcin Wiacek. You can find result of their
   work in Docs/protocol/ subdirectory in gnokii sources. Note that not all
   known protocol is already implemented in gnokii.

   Alternatively there are some web sites that have collated some
   information:
   
     Nokia 3110/3810/8110
       http://www.tec.puv.fi/~s98114/GSM/FBUS.html  
   
     Nokia 5110/6110
       http://www.gadgets.demon.co.uk/nokia61xx/protocol.html

     Marcin Wiacek's pages are also useful;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does gnokii work under Sun's Solaris?

A. Generally yes, but in fact it depends on hardware -- your serial port
   must support at least 115200 baud rate. Sun Enterprise 250 machine is known
   to work with gnokii.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Could somebody tell me the key for on, off and select menu in
    gnokii --keysequence function?

A. M: menu, N: names, P: power, G: green phone, R: red phone, U: up, D: down
   +: increase volume, -: decrease volume, 0123456789#* as is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get 'undefined symbol: GSM_ELogHandler' when runnig gnokii. What's
   wrong?

A. gnokii didn't install correctly. You had installed gnokii previously and you
   either forget to run 'make install' or the installation didn't overwrite the
   old library. Be sure to remove the old libgnokii.so and then rerun 'make
   install'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I got problems during the compilation with vcal.lx/vcal.c. What should I
   do?

A. Install flex. It should be available in every Linux distribution as well
   as in CygWin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Which cable for the Nokia phones should I use?

A. For Nokia 61X0/51X0 models you should use DAU9P cable. Nokia 61X0 models are
   also capable to make an infrared connection.

   For Nokia 7110/62X0/6310 models you need either DAU9P or DLR3P cable. With
   DLR3P cable you can use AT commands to talk to the phone. These phones are
   able to make an irda connection.

   Most Nokia phones that have no visible connector have one under the battery.
   See our cables page (http://www.gnokii.org/cables.shtml) to find the sites
   with more detailes, also the places where to buy the cable.

   Most of the modern phones have the irda connector (3XXX series models don't
   have them).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get 'Sorry, phone has not yet been converted to new style.
   Phone.Functions == NULL!' message. What's wrong?

A. You use ancient version of gnokii! Upgrade! See our downloads page for the
   detailes (http://www.gnokii.org/downloads.shtml).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get 'ERROR: Modem DCD is down and global/require_dcd parameter is set!'
   What should I do?

A. Either comment out require_dcd variable in the config file or set it to 0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I can't compile gnokii. It failes with po directory building.

A. You need to run gettextize. See autogen.sh and INSTALL files. If you don't
   have it on your system, grab the -current tarball which should have all
   needed files already generated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. My phone is not mentioned as supported by gnokii, but it seems that it is
   similiar to the one of the mentioned in the supported phones list? What
   should I do to check this out?

A. It is quite simple. If you use AT compatible phone you can just use
   'model = AT' in the config file. If you have Nokia and you would like to
   enable FBUS mode (it has more facilities then AT mode), there are few
   things you should do. Let's say, you want to check the support for Nokia
   6211, which should be compatible with Nokia 6210. First, let's find the
   correct driver. The drivers are located in the common/phones/ directory
   within the gnokii sources:

pkot@bzzzt:~/gnokii/common/phones$ grep -n 6210 *
nk7110.c:148:           "7110|6210|6250|7190",      /* Supported models */
nk7110.c:958:           /* This is ugly hack. But the picture message format in 6210
nk7110.c:1197:  /* Nokia 6210 and family does not show not "fixed" messages from the
nk7110.c:1610:  /* 6210/7110 needs to seek the first free pos to inhabit with next note */

   Interesting is the line 148. We define GSM_Phone structure there. Just
   add new model there, so the line will contain:

7110|6210|6250|7190|6211

   Once this is done, look into the common/misc.c file. We have there large
   phone capabilities table. Find the one for the phone that is similiar to
   your. In our case this is 6210:

{"6210",  "NPE-3", PM_CALLERGROUP | PM_CALENDAR | PM_SPEEDDIAL | PM_NETMONITOR | PM_EXTPBK | PM_SMS | PM_FOLDERS }

   We will replace two first fields as for our phone. The second fiels is
   the phone model identifier. In most of the phones to get this type on
   your phone keyboard the following sequence: *#0000#. If it doesn't work
   search the Internet for the information. Let's say in our example that
   the string is NPL-3. Our line will contain:

{"6211",  "NPL-3", PM_CALLERGROUP | PM_CALENDAR | PM_SPEEDDIAL | PM_NETMONITOR | PM_EXTPBK | PM_SMS | PM_FOLDERS }

   This is almost everything. If you have Linux and need to enable the IrDA
   connection, edit the common/devices/unixserial.c file. Find there the
   phone[] table. It contains the numerous Nokia models mentioned. Add your
   phone name there. In our case: "Nokia 6211". Recompile the sources and
   add "model = 6211" (according to your Nokia model) to the config and try
   if it works. In any case let us know (to the gnokii mailing list) about
   the result.
