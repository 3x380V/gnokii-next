Q. What is gnokii ?

A. It is a name of project. The aim of it is to develop tools and drivers
for Nokia mobile phones. Of course, I think in this moment about really
different tools - for example, modem drivers, console tools, etc.
All created here software is released under the GNU
General Public License. Please see COPYING file for more details on
license/copying issues, the lack of warranty and where to send a postcard
if you like gnokii :-). Anyway, our software works on many software
(Linux, Free BSD, etc.) and hardware (Intel, etc.) platforms...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do you pronounce gnokii ?

A. You can pronounce gnokii as "gnooki" or "gnocki" at your option :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I get "Hmmm... GSM_LinkOK never went true. Quitting." message when
   running gnokii. What's wrong ?

A. Gnokii cannot connect to the phone.  Possible reasons are:
    - wrong serial port is defined in gnokii config file,
    - you are using the wrong cable,
    - you are using not supported phone model,
    - you don't have permission to write to /dev/ttySX device.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What models are supported?

A. Currently supported phone models are:
         + 6110|6130|6150|6190|5110|5130|5190|3310|3210
         + 3110|3810|8110|8110i
         + 2110|2140|6080
         + 640
         + 5160|6160|6185
         + 6210|7110
   Support for these models is planned:
         + Dancall 2711
         + 8210|8250
         + Ericsson GA628 and similiar

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. `make install' sets mgnokiidev suid root.  Is this correct ?

A. Yes.  gnokiid needs to create a symbolic link in the /dev directory.
   mgnokiidev is the program which does this and hence it must be suid
   root so it can write to the directory.  mgnokiidev is executable only
   for gnokii group members (and root) so it presents minimal security
   problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Should any other gnokii binary be installed suid root?

A. No.  There's no need for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does gnokii support Nokia 3210/3310/6210/7110 phone ?

A. Yes it does. Support is not as full as with 6110 series but it is improving
every day now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can I get a copy of the protocol for the <insert phone model here> ?

A. We don't have any formal documentation of the protocols in use.
   The best source we can give you now is all our knowlegde assembled
   together by Nagy Balazs and Marcin Wiacek. You can find result of their
   work in Docs/protocol/ subdirectory in gnokii sources. Note that not all
   known protocol is already implemented in gnokii.

   Alternatively there are some web sites that have collated some
   information:
