README for MacOS X

Status
The MacOS X port of Gnokii currently supports only Gnokii for the Nokia 6210
phone. Other phones in the 7110 family are likely to work also with this
version.

XGnokii, and others
The graphical X version, the AT-emulater and virtual device are not ported
to MacOS X. This might change in the future but as far as I know no work is
in progress. Of course the effort of porting only makes sense if there is a
need. Do you have the need for extended MacOS X functionality don't ask me
but let us all know on the Gnokii mailing list.

Hardware
So far Gnokii has only been tested with a Keyspan USA-28Xb USB to Serial
adapter and a Nokia dlr-3p cable.
The MacOS X version does not work with IrDA (and probably never will). This
is not a problem of Gnokii but a problem with Apple. The MacOS X IrDA
protocol stack is completely undocumented thus unusable. Unless they change
this or someone ports the IrDA stack from linux we're out of luck, sorry.

Contents of my .gnokiirc file:
port = /dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1
model = 6210
initlength = default
