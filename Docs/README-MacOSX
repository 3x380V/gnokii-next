README for MacOS X
==================

Status
The MacOS X port of Gnokii has successfully been tested on some phones.
I expect all phones supported by gnokii to work (famous last words...)

XGnokii, and others
The graphical X version, the AT-emulater and virtual device are not ported
to MacOS X. This might change in the future but as far as I know no work is
in progress. Of course the effort of porting only makes sense if there is a
need. Do you have the need for extended MacOS X functionality don't ask me
but let us all know on the Gnokii mailing list.

Successfully tested hardware
USB to Serial adapters:
 - Keyspan USA-28Xb
 - BAFO technologies BF-810

Cables:
 - dlr3p

Phones:
 - 3410
 - 6210
 - 6310

Please report any new hardware not in this list on the Gnokii mailing list
<gnokii-users@nongnu.org>

IrDA
The MacOS X version *does not* work with IrDA (and probably never will).
This is not a problem of Gnokii but a problem with Apple. The MacOS X IrDA
protocol stack is completely undocumented thus unusable. Unless they change
this or someone ports the IrDA stack from linux we're out of luck, sorry.

Contents of my .gnokiirc file:
port = /dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1
model = 6210
initlength = default
connection = dlr3p
#require_dcd = 1
use_locking = no

Notes:
Always set "use_locking = no" otherwise gnokii won't work.
USB to serial adapters always introduce two new device files in /dev per
serial port. Use the one starting with "cu.".

Compiling
=========

This was only tested under 10.2. May not work with older versions. The
base directory of gnokii will be called <gnokii_dir>.

1. get and install fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net). Apart from the base
package (= the installer) nothing is needed.

2. copy the contents of /sw/share/aclocal to /usr/share/aclocal. You need
to be root to do this

3. call 'cd <gnokii_dir>'

4. call 'sh autogen.sh --disable-shared --disable-nls'

5. call 'make'

If after some time you now see
"##########################################
 ###
 ### It is strongly recommended to run:
 ### make install
 ### now. Otherwise gnokii may not work.
 ###
 ##########################################"

gnokii should be built OK
