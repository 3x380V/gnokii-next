README for MacOS X
==================

Status
The MacOS X port of Gnokii currently supports only Gnokii for the Nokia 
6210 phone. Other phones in the 7110 family are likely to work also with 
this version.

XGnokii, and others
The graphical X version, the AT-emulater and virtual device are not ported
to MacOS X. This might change in the future but as far as I know no work is
in progress. Of course the effort of porting only makes sense if there is a
need. Do you have the need for extended MacOS X functionality don't ask me
but let us all know on the Gnokii mailing list.

Hardware
So far Gnokii has only been tested with a Keyspan USA-28Xb USB to Serial
adapter and a Nokia dlr-3p cable.

IrDA 
The MacOS X version *does not* work with IrDA (and probably never will). 
This is not a problem of Gnokii but a problem with Apple. The MacOS X IrDA
protocol stack is completely undocumented thus unusable. Unless they change
this or someone ports the IrDA stack from linux we're out of luck, sorry.

Contents of my .gnokiirc file:
port = /dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1
model = 6210
initlength = default
connection = dlr3p
#require_dcd = 1


Compiling
=========

This was only tested under 10.2.1. May not work with other versions. The
base directory of gnokii will be called <gnokii_dir>. 

1. get and install fink (fink.sourceforge.org). Apart from the base 
package (= the installer) nothing is needed.

2. copy the contents of /sw/share/aclocal to /usr/share/aclocal. You need
to be root to do this

3. call Ôcd <gnokii_dir>Ô

4. call 'sh autogen.sh --disable-shared --disable-nls'

5. call 'make' 
this should fail with
"ld: archive: ../getopt/libgetopt.a has no table of contents, add one with 
ranlib(1) (can't load from it)"

6. call 'ranlib getopt/libgetopt.a'

7. call 'make' again
If you now see
"##########################################
###
### It is strongly recommended to run:
### make install
### now. Otherwise gnokii may not work.

" 
gnokii should be built OK
