============

The graphical X version, the AT-emulator and virtual device are not ported to
Win32. This might change in the future but as far as I know no work is in
progress. Of course the effort of porting only makes sense if there is a need.
Do you have the need for extended Win32 functionality don't ask me but let us
all know on the Gnokii mailing list.

Compile using Microsoft Visual C++
====================================================

Below a description how to compile Gnokii with the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.

1) Put the Gnokii source in <path>\gnokii\gnokii src.
2) Copy <path>\win32\MSVC6\config.h into <path>\include\
3) Open <path>\win32\MSVC6\gnokii.dsw and compile :)

Compile with Cygwin (B20)
=========================

This is in fact the easiest option. Because Cygwin implements a GNU (Unix style) 
environment on your PC you can almost compile Gnokii 'as is' out of the box. 

There are just a few steps extra needed to tweak the Makefile. Read the comments 
in the Makefile. Actually you might want to keep the '-s' in the LDFLAGS since 
this strips debug information and keeps your executable lean.

Cross compiling with MinGW
==========================

You can easily cross compile gnokii with MinGW, just follow these instructions:
1) run autoheader
2) edit win32/mingw-cross/mingw-cross.sh according to your MinGW setup
3) run make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo to install


Disclaimer
==========

No warranty, you are on your own. We are looking for maintainer of Win32 port.
