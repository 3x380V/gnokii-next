-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the Dancall phones --

* Notes *

Dancalls are crappy telephones, commonly found in czech republic. In
bazaar, you can find good phones on one table, bad phones on another
table, and dancalls in nearby trashcan. Dancall for $10 is too
expensive, in fact it is $10 more than it is worth.

OTOH, dancalls try to speak something like AT-commands over serial
cable, which made their decoding pretty easy. And they include netmon
by default (just type *#9993#).

You *need* setserial /dev/ttyS0 low_latency in order for dancall
support to work.
