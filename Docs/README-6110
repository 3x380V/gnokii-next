-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 6110 series --

* Notes *

Code for the 6110 phones has been tested with the DAU-9P MBus Cable NSE-3.

Phones of 6110 Series have somewhat different protocol and that
is the main reason for having the 3810 Series and 6110 Series.
These phones also provide more features so hacking on it is
greater fun.

The current code allows you to enter PIN from the PC (gnokii asks
you for the PIN, you enter it and gnokii sends it to the phone
without touching the phone's keyboard). The code also allows you
to monitor the status of the mobile phone - it recognizes
network signal strength, your GSM provider network and battery
level, the clock, date and alarm setting of your phone (if the phone
supports it - e.g. 5110 doesn't seem to support date so the date is
bogus on it).

The newest feature is that gnokii can read your mobile phone's
preferred SMS Center so in the future you will not need to enter
the SMS Message Center number for SMS messages to be sent.
Gnokii will read it automatically.

There are some problems with the newest firmwares (V 05.24). It
seems that this firmware is weird. If you have a Nokia with this
firmware, it accepts the PIN request (displays Code Accepted message)
but nothing is returned to the PC. The communication is only in
one direction :-( I do not know why. If you can help with this,
please let me know.

* Known Bugs *

- None, we write quality software here... :)

* To-do *

- writing documentation of the protocol

- check out errors when reading and writing phonebook entries!!!

- delete all FIXME from the sources

- implement calendar notes infrastructure and --getcalendarnote, --writecalendarnote

- implement function FB61_GetStatus which should return {"Waiting for PIN",
  "Registered within the network", "Call in progress" ...}

- X interface :-)

- how NCDS saves names with ";" in it?

- make util directory with support utilities, clean up the source tree...

- Wait for ack of Auth message
