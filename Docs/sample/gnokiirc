# Set port to the physical serial port used to connect to your phone.
# Linux version is:
port = /dev/ttyS0
#
# For MacOSX you will need something like:
# port = /dev/cu.USA28X1P1.1
#
# For Win32 you want to use:
# port = com1:
# or similiar.
#
# Use this setting also for the Bluetooth connection:
# port = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

# Set model to the model number of your phone. For the
# Symbian phones use:
# model = series60
# For other non-Nokia phones and when you want to use AT
# mode use:
# model = AT
# If you can't figure out what to put here read the FAQ.
# If it still doesn't help, consult gnokii-ml or #gnokii at freenode.

# Initlength controls the number of characters sent to the
# phone during initialisation.  You can either set it to
# the word "default" or a positive integer.
#
# You can try setting this value if you want to connect
# to the phone quicker.  If you've never noticed the
# connection to be slow, it is suggested that you
# leave this alone.  Read the initialisation code in fbus-xxxx
# to understand what this changes if you're curious.

# The type of the connection, for IR set this to infrared or irda.
# For the nk6110 driver only infrared is valid for the IrDA connection.
# See Docs/gnokii-ir-howto for more detailes on this.
# If you have 6210/6250/7110 phone and dau9p cable (the one you can
# use with 6100 series and cannot use hardware modem from the phone)
# you may want to use 'dau9p' value to get faster initialization.
# If you use dlr3 or dlr3p cable for nokia phones in FBUS mode (ie.
# you don't use model = AT) you may want to use 'dlr3p' value here.
# Note that it is recommended and currently the best way to use this
# cable with nk6510 driver.

# Set this to 'yes' if you want gnokii to set and check the lock file in
# /var/lock directory. It avoids potential conflicts with other serial

# There may happen various timeouts during the communication with the phone.
